# Bachelor Degree Project

This represents my bachelor degree thesis, in which I used Deep Learning libraries for creating a Convolutional Neural Network for detecting facial emotions. 

These emotions would further be used as part of the recommendation engine, realized using machine learning, that would recommend songs in a therapeutic way. 

These two modules were integrated into a web platform, that used SQLite, SQLAlchemy, flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the YouTube API for embedding songs.
